# When you start looking at basic code with envy,
## because

<br/>
<br/>

###### it has no dependencies

<br/>
<br/>

###### it only does one thing

<br/>
<br/>


basically because it has low cognitive charge?
<br/>
<br/>

##### ... then a framework would come in handy.

    A framework lets you write with simplicity once again, because you can confidently
    delegate responsability on the computer.

In other words it should be encouraged the automation of tasks, the avoidance of repetition, which eventually would end up on the creation of a domain specific language, or DSL.

Every developer in a long term project should develop an intimacy, a dialect, to which he and others would come in terms with in order to talk to the computer.

Today I will show you a small glimpse of a dialect I made in the last few months to create UI, using JSON.

Here's a  happy path to be crossed by every developer that wants to eventually success in having a long term relationship with a project, and reach intimacy with the computer.

<br/>
<br/>

1. ##### Dont let your job be repetitive!
2. #### Dont repeat yourself!
3. ##### Create functions that are the most atomic!
4. ##### Create functions that are the most composable!

<br/>

 If you do not take decisions, you will not have to change them later on! Thus:
5. ##### Strategy pattern
6. ##### First order functions, they rock!
This will allow you to avoid revisiting your code later on.
<br/>
<br/>

#### TL;DR:
Just respect the following principles.

##### DRY
##### Open-Close
